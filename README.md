## Overview

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users surveys and  then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

*I used Express.js to handle the routing and deploed my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

## Description of App

* Home Page gives the user the opportunity to start the survey as well as see who is currently on the friend list by clicking the API Friend List at the bottom of the page.
* Clicking on Go To Survey button will provide a form built with bootstrap that the user can complete.
* Once the user has completed filling out the survey, a modal will pop up explaining who is their new best friend is. I used Parks and Rec characters as my stand in data :).
* Deployed using Heroku and Github.
