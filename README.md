# FriendFinder - Node and Express Servers

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users surveys and  then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express.js to handle the routing and deploed my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
